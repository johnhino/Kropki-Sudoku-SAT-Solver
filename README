The sudoku solver requires the SAT4J core library, which can be downloaded at http://download.forge.ow2.org/sat4j/ , the file name should be sat4j-core-v20130525.zip.
When you open the code in your IDE of choice (I used IntelliJ), just add the module to the project, which should be labeled org.sat4j.core.jar

As shown in the test file, a Kropki Sudoku board with no dots is both satisfiable, and appears to only have one solution. Thus, a Sudoku board exists where no 
adjacent cells have consecutive values, nor is any cell double that of an adjacent cell.
